### Welcome to Kinisi

### About


The goal of Kinisi is simple: to allow anybody and everybody a privacy-focused alternative to other activity trackers currently on the market. Kinisi aims to be low bloat, open source, free range, and organic, all while providing advanced analytics on different sports and outdoor activities.

### Features

* **Tracking:** Track and record your activities
* **Analytics:** View statistics on your activities
* **Trail search:** Find new hikes in your area
* **Wearable integration:**  We plan to be compatible with Gadgetbridge, an Android (4.4+) application that will allow you to use your Pebble, Mi Band, Amazfit Bip, and HPlus device (and more) without the vendor's closed-source application and without the need to create an account and transmit any of your data to the vendor's servers.
